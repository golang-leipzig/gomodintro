Go modules are in experimental phase since [Go
1.11](https://golang.org/doc/go1.11#modules) (August 2018). There is a long
history, quite some theory and a few tooling changes related to versioning and
dependency management in Go. At [Golang and Cloud Native Meetup Leipzig
#3](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/events/260338152/)
highlighted a bit of the background and live coded some examples.
